The Fortissimo project was a PHP killboard created some years ago for the MMO
EVE Online.  This project was never actually used for anything other than a
proof of concept, although it was originally built for CLS back when ASCN was
still a force to be reckoned with.

This is mostly kept around for posterity.  It's not under current development.
